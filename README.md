## Setup

### 1. API Key

First, get a CloudGlue API Key from [cloudglue.dev](http://cloudglue.dev), this will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your CloudGlue account.

### 2. Configure MCP client

Next, configure your MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) to use this MCP server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON, for `cloudglue-mcp-server` this would look like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@aviaryhq/cloudglue-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLOUDGLUE_API_KEY": "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
        }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR-API-KEY>` with the API Key created in step 1. Alternatively instead of the environment variable you could pass in the API key to the server via the `--api-key` CLI flag.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. API Key

First, get a CloudGlue API Key from [cloudglue.dev](http://cloudglue.dev), this will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your CloudGlue account.

### 2. Install and build server locally

You can build this server locally via:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Configure MCP client

Next, configure your MCP client (such as Cursor) to use this server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "cloudglue-mcp-server": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": [
              "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/cloudglue-mcp-server/build/index.js",
              "--api-key",
              "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
          ]
      }
  }
}
```
