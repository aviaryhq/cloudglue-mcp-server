## Setup

### 1. API Key

First, get a Cloudglue API Key from [cloudglue.dev](http://cloudglue.dev), this will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your Cloudglue account.

### 2. Configure MCP client

Next, configure your MCP client (e.g. Claude Desktop) to use this MCP server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON, for `cloudglue-mcp-server` this would look like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@aviaryhq/cloudglue-mcp-server@latest",
        "--api-key",
        "<CLOUDGLUE-YOUR-API-KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<CLOUDGLUE-YOUR-API-KEY>` with the API Key created in step 1.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. API Key

First, get a Cloudglue API Key from [cloudglue.dev](http://cloudglue.dev), this will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your Cloudglue account.

### 2. Install and build server locally

You can build this server locally via:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Configure MCP client

Next, configure your MCP client (such as Cursor) to use this server. Most MCP clients store the configuration as JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "cloudglue-mcp-server": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": [
              "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/cloudglue-mcp-server/build/index.js",
              "--api-key",
              "<CLOUDGLUE-YOUR-API-KEY>"
          ]
      }
  }
}
```

## Tools

The following Cloudglue tools are available to LLMs through this MCP server:

### **Discovery & Navigation**

- **`list_collections`**: Discover available video collections and their basic metadata. Use this first to understand what video collections exist before using other collection-specific tools. Shows collection IDs needed for other tools, video counts, and collection types.

- **`list_videos`**: Browse and search video metadata with powerful filtering options. Use this to explore available videos, find specific content by date, or see what's in a collection. Returns essential video info like duration, filename, and IDs needed for other tools.

### **Individual Video Analysis**

- **`describe_video`**: Get comprehensive transcripts and descriptions from individual videos (YouTube or Cloudglue upload) with intelligent cost optimization. Automatically checks for existing transcripts before creating new ones. Use this for individual video analysis - for analyzing multiple videos in a collection, use retrieve_collection_transcripts instead. Supports both YouTube and Cloudglue videos with different analysis levels.

- **`extract_video_entities`**: Extract structured data and entities from videos using custom prompts with intelligent cost optimization. Automatically checks for existing extractions before creating new ones. Use this for individual video analysis - for analyzing multiple videos in a collection, use retrieve_collection_entities instead. The quality of results depends heavily on your prompt specificity.

- **`get_video_metadata`**: Get comprehensive technical metadata about a Cloudglue video file including duration, resolution, file size, processing status, and computed statistics. Use this when you need video specifications, file details, or processing information rather than content analysis. Different from content-focused tools like describe_video.

### **Collection Analysis**

- **`retrieve_transcript_summaries`**: Bulk retrieve video summaries and titles from a collection to quickly understand its content and themes. Perfect for getting a high-level overview of what's in a collection, identifying common topics, or determining if a collection contains relevant content for a specific query. Use this as your first step when analyzing a collection - it's more efficient than retrieving full transcripts and helps you determine if you need more detailed information. Only proceed to retrieve_collection_transcripts if you need the full multimodal context for specific videos identified through the summaries. Returns up to 50 summaries per request with pagination support.

- **`retrieve_collection_transcripts`**: Bulk retrieve rich multimodal transcripts (text, audio, and visual) from a collection with advanced filtering. Use this only after using retrieve_transcript_summaries to identify specific videos that need detailed analysis. This tool is more resource-intensive and limited to 10 transcripts per request, so it's best used for targeted analysis of specific videos rather than broad collection overview. For single videos, use describe_video instead. Use date filtering to focus on specific time periods.

- **`retrieve_collection_entities`**: Batch retrieve structured entity data from multiple videos in a collection. Entities can be user-defined based on what's important for your collection (people, objects, concepts, custom categories). Perfect for data mining, building datasets, or analyzing previously extracted entities at scale. Supports pagination and date-based filtering to manage large result sets. For individual video entities, use extract_video_entities instead.

- **`find_video_collection_moments`**: AI-powered semantic search to find specific moments, topics, or content within a video collection. Returns relevant segments with context, timestamps, and citations. Perfect for finding needle-in-haystack content, specific discussions, or thematic analysis across multiple videos. Much more targeted than bulk retrieval tools.

### **When to Use Which Tool**

- **Start exploring**: Use `list_collections` and `list_videos` to explore available content
- **For single videos**: Use `describe_video` or `extract_video_entities` 
- **For collection overview**: Always start with `retrieve_transcript_summaries` to efficiently understand what's in a collection
- **For detailed analysis**: Only use `retrieve_collection_transcripts` for specific videos that need full multimodal context, identified through summaries
- **For structured data**: Use `retrieve_collection_entities` for bulk entity extraction
- **For specific content**: Use `find_video_collection_moments` for targeted semantic search
- **For technical specs**: Use `get_video_metadata`

All tools include intelligent features like cost optimization, automatic fallbacks, and comprehensive error handling.
