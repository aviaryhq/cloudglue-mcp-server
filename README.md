# Usage

## Prerequisites

First, get a Cloudglue API Key from [cloudglue.dev](http://cloudglue.dev), this will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your Cloudglue account.

### A. On any MCP client using a JSON configuration

Most MCP clients store their configuration as JSON. For `cloudglue-mcp-server` this would look like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudglue": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@aviaryhq/cloudglue-mcp-server@latest",
        "--api-key",
        "<CLOUDGLUE-YOUR-API-KEY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<CLOUDGLUE-YOUR-API-KEY>` with the API Key created earlier.

### B. On Claude Desktop using Desktop Extensions

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; align-items: center;">

## Tools

The following Cloudglue tools are available to LLMs through this MCP server:

### **Discovery & Navigation**

- **`list_collections`**: Discover available video collections and their basic metadata. Use this first to understand what video collections exist before using other collection-specific tools. Shows collection IDs needed for other tools, video counts, and collection types. For collections with type 'media-descriptions', use `describe_video` with the collection_id parameter to fetch previously extracted descriptions for a given Cloudglue file. For collections with type 'entities', use `extract_video_entities` with the collection_id parameter to fetch previously extracted entities for a given Cloudglue file. **Pagination**: Results are paginated in 20 collections per page using the `page` parameter (page 0 = first 20 collections, page 1 = next 20 collections, etc.). Each response includes `page` and `total_pages` fields. For comprehensive exploration, paginate through all collections by incrementing the `page` parameter until you've retrieved all pages.

- **`list_videos`**: Browse and search video metadata with powerful filtering options. Use this to explore available videos, find specific content by date, or see what's in a collection. Returns essential video info like duration, filename, and IDs needed for other tools. **Pagination**: Results are paginated in 20 videos per page using the `page` parameter (page 0 = first 20 videos, page 1 = next 20 videos, etc.). Each response includes `page` and `total_pages` fields. Use date filtering to focus on specific time periods, then paginate within those results.

### **Individual Video Analysis**

- **`describe_video`**: Get comprehensive transcripts and descriptions from individual videos with intelligent cost optimization and pagination support. Automatically checks for existing transcripts before creating new ones. Supports all URL formats: Cloudglue URLs, YouTube URLs, public HTTP video URLs, and data connector URLs (Dropbox, Google Drive, Zoom). **Pagination**: Results are paginated in 5-minute segments using the `page` parameter (page 0 = first 5 minutes, page 1 = next 5 minutes, etc.). Each response includes `page`, `total_pages`, and `description` fields in JSON format. Use pagination to efficiently process longer videos by retrieving descriptions in manageable chunks. Note: Collection descriptions (when using `collection_id`) only support page 0 and return the full description.

- **`extract_video_entities`**: Extract structured data and entities from videos using custom prompts with intelligent cost optimization and pagination support. Automatically checks for existing extractions before creating new ones. Supports all URL formats: Cloudglue URLs, YouTube URLs, public HTTP video URLs, and data connector URLs (Dropbox, Google Drive, Zoom). The quality of results depends heavily on your prompt specificity. **Pagination**: Segment-level entities are paginated (25 segments per page) using the `page` parameter. Each response includes `video_level_entities` and `segment_level_entities` with `entities`, `page`, and `total_pages` fields in JSON format.

- **`get_video_metadata`**: Get comprehensive technical metadata about a Cloudglue video file including duration, resolution, file size, processing status, and computed statistics. Use this when you need video specifications, file details, or processing information rather than content analysis. Different from content-focused tools like describe_video.

- **`segment_video_camera_shots`**: Segment videos into camera shots with intelligent cost optimization. Automatically checks for existing shot segmentation jobs before creating new ones. Returns timestamps and metadata for each camera shot detected. Supports Cloudglue URLs, public HTTP video URLs, and data connector URLs (Dropbox, Google Drive, Zoom). Note: YouTube URLs are not supported for camera shot segmentation.

- **`segment_video_chapters`**: Segment videos into chapters with intelligent cost optimization. Automatically checks for existing chapter segmentation jobs before creating new ones. Returns timestamps and descriptions for each chapter detected. Supports all URL formats: Cloudglue URLs, YouTube URLs, public HTTP video URLs, and data connector URLs (Dropbox, Google Drive, Zoom).

### **Collection Analysis**

- **`retrieve_summaries`**: Bulk retrieve video summaries and titles from a collection to quickly understand its content and themes. Works with both rich-transcripts and media-descriptions collections. Perfect for getting a high-level overview of what's in a collection, identifying common topics, or determining if a collection contains relevant content for a specific query. Use this as your first step when analyzing a collection - it's more efficient than retrieving full descriptions and helps you determine if you need more detailed information. For targeted content discovery, consider using search_video_summaries or search_video_moments instead of browsing through all summaries. **Pagination**: Results are paginated in 10 summaries per page using the `page` parameter (page 0 = first 10 summaries, page 1 = next 10 summaries, etc.). Each response includes `page` and `total_pages` fields. For comprehensive collection analysis, paginate through all summaries by incrementing the `page` parameter until you've retrieved all pages.

- **`search_video_moments`**: AI-powered semantic search to find specific video segments within a collection. Uses Cloudglue's search API to locate relevant moments across speech, on-screen text, and visual descriptions. Returns structured search results with timestamps and metadata. Perfect for finding needle-in-haystack spoken and visual content, specific discussions, or thematic analysis. Returns up to 20 relevant video moments per query.

- **`search_video_summaries`**: AI-powered semantic search to find relevant videos within a collection. Uses Cloudglue's search API to locate videos based on their content, summaries, and metadata. Works with rich-transcripts and media-descriptions collections. Returns structured search results with video information and relevance scores. Perfect for discovering videos by topic, theme, or content similarity. Returns up to 20 relevant videos per query.

### **Pagination Strategy**

**When to Paginate Exhaustively:**

- User asks for "all" or "complete" analysis of collections/videos
- User wants comprehensive coverage or exhaustive exploration
- User requests data mining, dataset building, or complete entity extraction
- User asks for "everything" in a collection or time period

**How to Paginate:**

All tools use page-based pagination (`list_collections`, `list_videos`, `describe_video`, `extract_video_entities`, `retrieve_summaries`):
1. Start with initial request (page=0)
2. Check response `total_pages` field
3. If `page < total_pages - 1`, increment `page` and repeat
4. Continue until you've retrieved all pages or have sufficient data

**Page sizes by tool:**
- `list_collections`: 20 collections per page
- `list_videos`: 20 videos per page
- `describe_video`: 5 minutes per page
- `extract_video_entities`: 25 segment entities per page
- `retrieve_summaries`: 10 summaries per page

### **When to Use Which Tool**

- **Start exploring**: Use `list_collections` and `list_videos` to explore available content
- **For single videos**: Use `describe_video`, `extract_video_entities`, `segment_video_camera_shots`, or `segment_video_chapters`
- **For collection overview**: Always start with `retrieve_summaries` to efficiently understand what's in a collection
- **For detailed analysis**: Use `describe_video` for specific videos that need full multimodal context, identified through summaries
- **For structured data**: Use `extract_video_entities` for entity extraction from individual videos
- **For specific content**: Use `search_video_moments` for targeted segment search, `search_video_summaries` for video-level search
- **For technical specs**: Use `get_video_metadata`

All tools include intelligent features like cost optimization, automatic fallbacks, and comprehensive error handling.
